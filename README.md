# My approach to solve LeetCode problems

I have tried to solve CodeForces but it's not as fun a solving LeetCode ones!

## TypeScript

```
cd ts
npm i # if not yet
# create a solution file with problem no in `ts/src` dir. Like, `src/27.ts`
./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc # compiles everything
./dist/27.js
```
